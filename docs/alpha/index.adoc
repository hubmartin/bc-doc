= ALPHA SET

_Welcome to BigClown Labs’ Alpha Set Git repository!_


== What is it?

The Alpha Set is a bundle of hardware and software components enabling you to easily build your next home *Internet-of-Things* (IoT) projects.
Our system is extremely modular.
The individual modules provide various communication interfaces, sensors and actuators.
And the best part?
It is all open-source!

With this system you can instantly:

* Monitor *temperature*
* Monitor *humidity*
* Monitor *CO2 concentration* (carbon dioxide)
* Monitor *light intensity*
* Monitor *atmospheric pressure*
* Monitor *altitude*
* Control *relays*

We have a lot of ideas where to go next, but let’s call it _THE START_. :-)
The next priority is to make the nodes wireless and battery-operated.

Our software platform builds on proven internet standards, protocols and components which are easy to integrate into your home automation application.


== Hardware configuration

You can see the example hardware configuration in the picture below:

== System concept

The system concept of the Alpha Set is best presented by the following block diagram:

== Where do I get it?

Well, our project has not officially started yet.
That’s why we call this early stage as “alpha”. :-)

We work hard to launch our e-shop by the beginning of October.
However, if you want to get the Alpha Set or any of its substantial components earlier, please contact us at:

== How do I get started?

For the very first steps please see one of the following links:

* Quick Start Guide in English (coming soon)
* https://www.bigclown.com/alpha[Quick Start Guide in Czech]


== Software setup

The Alpha Set hardware might be connected to either an *embedded* or *desktop* platform.

*Click on one* of the corresponding configuration below for further instructions:


=== Embedded Platform

* <<raspberry-pi#, *Raspberry Pi*>> (model 2 and 3 is supported)


=== Desktop Platform

* <<macos#, *macOS*>> (version 10.10+ is supported)
* <<ubuntu#, *Ubuntu Desktop*>> (version 16.04 LTS is supported)
* <<windows#, *Windows*>> (version 7, 8.x & 10 is supported)


== Where to go next?

If you want to learn about our hardware design internals or provide feedback on it, please check our link:/hardware[hardware folder] where you will find:

* link:/hardware/sch[Schematic drawings]
* link:/hardware/asm[Assembly drawings]

We design all the hardware in Eagle and the related design files altogether with the libraries will be released later (sometimes in October).

If you have any ideas to share about the overall concept, products or software, please contact us at:
