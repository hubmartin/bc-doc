. Write down your Auth Token (or let the application to send it to you by the E-mail).

. Go to your Hub.
  Stop it by `docker stop hub` and remove running image by `docker rm hub`.

. Re-run Docker with environmental variable `BLYNK_TOKEN`:
+
[source]
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 1883:1883 --privileged -v /dev:/dev \
  -v $HOME/hub:/var/hub -h hub-container --env BLYNK_TOKEN=da9d7ee58efabcdef123456789 \
  --name hub bigclownlabs/hub
+
If you are running on the Raspberry Pi, then you should use `--name hub bigclownlabs/rpi-hub`
+
Notice the part `--env BLYNK_TOKEN=da9d7ee58efabcdef123456789` – you have to fill in your Blynk token you have obtained in step 3.
+
WARNING: Do not put this part *after* the name! It will not work!

. Create an Menu elemet for LED.
  Set output as virtual pin V1 (see below for pin assignment).
