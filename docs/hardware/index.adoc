== CO2 Module

image:co2-module.png[width=300, role="related thumb left"]

Carbon dioxide (or CO^2^) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth.
Its nominal concentration is about 400 ppm (0.04 %).
There are many occurrences of CO2 in nature.
For example humans produce CO2 using their respiration system during the exhalation phase.
High concentration of CO2 leads to acidity and various health related problems.
This is what motivated us to develop CO2 Module.
This module achieves ±50 ppm accuracy using a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor LP8 designed by SenseAir company from Sweden.
Thanks to its low-power operation it can be powered from batteries for years.
BigClown has equipped LP8 sensor with additional circuitry for efficient power management and I^2^C-only interfacing.
Enhancing your environmental monitoring with CO2 Module from BigClown has never been easier.
Last but not least feature of this module are three extra 5-pin sockets allowing to connect BigClown tags (I^2^C peripheral in a common form factor).

Moreover you can directly connect (via a 3-terminal block) a programmable RGB(W) LED strip with 5V interface (voltage translation logic is implemented) which is great for driving WS2812B-compatible LEDs.
Reliability is as important for us as it is for you.
That's why we have implemented smart overvoltage, undervoltage and reverse polarity protection on the power jack input to guarantee the input voltage range to always stay within the proper limits.

Sometimes you need to measure signals during both hardware and software development cycle.
And to see what's going on, you need to quickly hook up an appropriate equipment like like oscilloscope, logic analyzer, etc.
We have made that task simple with Probe Module.

== Relay Module

image:relay-module.png[width=300, role="related thumb left"]

Relay Module is suitable for switching small power appliances - e.g. LED strip, cooling fan, siren, buzzer, garage door opener, etc.
A cool feature of this module is a latching relay (also called bistable relay).
This feature makes this module suitable for battery-operated applications.
What does it mean?
For this type of relay the energy is needed only during transition state of the relay.
Once the new state has been set it is not necessary to energize the coil anymore - it will simply "remember" (or latch) its state.
Switching period is indicated using green LED (software defined "true state"), or using red LED (software defined "false state").
This module is I^2^C-only peripheral so it does not allocate any extra signals from BigClown header.

* Bistable (latching) relay for switching loads up to 60 W:
** 12 V DC / 5 A
** 24 V DC / 2.5 A
* Suitable for battery-operated applications

* 10-year warranty


== Tag Module

image:tag-module.png[width=300, role="related thumb left"]

Some BigClown modules have one or more extra 5-pin sockets allowing to connect a BigClown tag (I^2^C peripheral in a common form factor).
But sometimes this is still not enough or you need to extend the I^2^C bus with an additional channel.
Tag Module enables to connect up to six extra tags.
Every tag has a unique I^2^C address.
Using two independent I^2^C buses (I2C0 and I2C1) makes it possible to connect two tags of the same address to a single BigClown node.
